UO Rust Libs
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AngryLawyer/uo-rust-libs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AngryLawyer/uo-rust-libs)

Rust libraries for reading Ultima Online data files. This is still pre-1.0, and has yet to be thoroughly tested, and the API WILL likely change several times before then, so use at your own peril.

This has been tested on a fresh install of Ultima Online: Age of Shadows - I am not sure if more modern clients will work with it, although older clients should. Let me know!
